## What are Data Structures in Java?

Data Structure in Java is defined as the collection of data pieces that offer an effective means of storing and organizing data in a computer. Linked List, Stack, Queue, and arrays are a few examples of Java data structures.

There are two types of Data Structures:-

1. **Primitive Data Structures**
2. **Non-primitive Data Structures**

### Primitive Data Structures
Primitive data Structures are also called Primitive Data Types. `byte`, `short`, `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`, `long`, and `double` are primitive Data types.

### Non-primitive Data Structures
Non-primitive Data Structures are of two types:-

1. **Linear Data Structures**
2. **Non-linear Data Structures**

### Linear Data Structures
The elements arranged in a linear fashion are called Linear Data Structures. Here, each element is connected to one other element only. Linear Data Structures are as follows:

- **Arrays**
    - Single dimensional Array
    - Multidimensional Array
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
    - Singly-linked list
    - Doubly Linked list
    - Circular Linked List

### Non-Linear Data Structures
The elements arranged in a non-linear fashion are called Non-Linear Data Structures. Here, each element is connected to n-other elements. Non-Linear Data Structures are as follows:

- **Trees**
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - AVL Tree
    - Red-Black Tree
- **Graph**
- **Heap**
    - MaxHeap
    - MinHeap
- **Hash**
    - HashSet
    - HashMap
