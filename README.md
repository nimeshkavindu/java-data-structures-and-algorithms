## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find detailed explanations and examples of various data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. Whether you're a beginner learning the basics or an experienced developer looking to refresh your knowledge, these notes will guide you through fundamental concepts and best practices.

## Data Structures

Explore different data structures, including:

- [Arrays](Arrays.md)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- and more...

Each data structure includes explanations of its properties, operations, and common use cases, along with Java implementations and example code.

## Algorithms

Learn about essential algorithms, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- and more...

Discover how these algorithms work, their time and space complexity analysis, and practical implementations in Java.
